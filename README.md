# Java-Tetris-Game
Final project for CS420

The purpose of this project is to research and build a generational AI for Tetris that utilizes operating techniques for optimization.

This project will use existing code to build a basic tetris game, as the main focus is the building of the optimized AI. AI creation will begin with research into generational AI and how/when to implement operating system techniques. On each thread, the AI will be running a tetris game with a small variation in the techniques used to play that game. Each generation of our AI will build upon the techniques used in the highest-scoring tetris game and will vary them further in the next generation. After learning from many generations, the AI should be capable of running a high scoring tetris game.
